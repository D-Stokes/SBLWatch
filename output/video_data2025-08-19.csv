Double thumb used to be my worst nightmare—until Ian dropped a course that made it look way too fun to ignore. In this video, I break down how I finally got it together, plus a slap riff to help you do the same. If you’ve ever struggled with this technique, you’re in good company!

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Double thumb used to be my worst nightmare—until Ian dropped a course that made it look way too fun to ignore. In this video, I break down how I finally got it together, plus a slap riff to help you do the same. If you’ve ever struggled with this technique, you’re in good company!

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Double thumb used to be my worst nightmare—until Ian dropped a course that made it look way too fun to ignore. In this video, I break down how I finally got it together, plus a slap riff to help you do the same. If you’ve ever struggled with this technique, you’re in good company!

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.
