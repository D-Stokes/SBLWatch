Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.

Punk meets Motown? In this lesson, Ian breaks down A Town Called Malice by The Jam—a bass line that’s all feel, motion, and attitude. From the jumpy, soul-inspired groove to the driving verse, there’s a lot going on under the hood. 

You’ll hear the Motown influence - but played like it’s late for a train.
Grab your bass and dig in—this one’s all about getting it in your hands and feeling it for yourself.
